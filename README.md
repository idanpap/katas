# [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) katas and [www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges

<p>In this repo I show the katas (technical challenges) I try to solve daily. This is normally what I do at the start of my time on my machine, in order to get my brain in working order.The majority is done in Javascript, but I am adding Python to the mix too.<p>
